# Palindrome Check

This code snippet provides a function to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

The code is provided in different programming languages for reference.

## Python

The `check_if_palindrome(s)` function in Python checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

## JavaScript

The `checkIfPalindrome(s)` function in JavaScript performs a similar task of checking if a string `s` is a palindrome. It uses a two-pointer approach to compare characters from both ends of the string.

## Java

The `checkIfPalindrome(String s)` function in Java also checks if a string `s` is a palindrome. It utilizes a two-pointer approach to compare characters from both ends of the string.

## C++

The `checkIfPalindrome(string s)` function in C++ checks if a string `s` is a palindrome. It follows a two-pointer approach to compare characters from both ends of the string.

Feel free to use the code snippet in your projects or modify it as needed. Contributions are welcome!
