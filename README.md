# Palindrome Check

This code snippet provides a function to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

The code is provided in different programming languages for reference.

## Python

The `check_if_palindrome(s)` function in Python checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends. It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
